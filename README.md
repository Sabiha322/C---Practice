# C Practice Repository

This is my C programming practice repository where I’m learning the fundamentals of coding and improving my logic. These programs are part of my learning journey as a B.Tech Computer Science student at NBKR Institute of Science and Technology.

## 🔹 What's Inside

### 📁 basics/
- `hello_world.c` – My first C program to display "Hello, World!" on the screen.
- `sum_of_two_numbers.c` – Takes two user inputs and prints their sum.

## 🚀 About Me
I’m currently in my 1st year and learning C programming along with Data Structures and Algorithms. I use this space to practice and track my progress as I grow step-by-step.

Stay tuned for more beginner-friendly C programs! 💻✨
